An attention-based neural network for predicting phenotypic traits from SNP data with interpretable weights.

## üöÄ Features
- **Attention Mechanism**: Learns SNP importance weights 
- **Residual Connection**: Preserves original SNP information
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Supports FP16/FP32 via `autocast` 
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with configurable patience
- **Visualization**: Automatic plotting of training metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
We provided a pre-packaged Conda environment for directly running SNPWeightNet.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Run SNPWeightNet
We provide a step-by-step guide for running SNPWeightNet.
